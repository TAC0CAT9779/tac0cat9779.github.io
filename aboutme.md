HI! I'm TAC0CAT9779. This is my blog. Eventually, I might make this more than a blog, but for now it's just a blog.  

Anyway, I'm going to write about... things. I don't know if I need to have something specific. I don't have anything in specific, so it doesn't matter, I guess. I'm probably going to write about myself a bit, but also about my thoughts on things and stuff like that.  

Anyway, I hope you enjoy reading my posts (once I start posting them) and be sure to comment something (if you want) and, uuuhhh... yeah.  

About my personality: I'm a temperamental, extroverted introverted KFC bargain bucket. I don't even know anymore. =\|
